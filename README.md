# Livelink.js v1.0

User facing interface with as many helper functions as we want.

# Questions

-   ~~Do we need to support multiple sessions in a single page?~~ YES
-   Add an option to send the depth buffer to allow better composition with WebGL?
-   Do we merge the editor connection and the renderer connection behind a single interface?
-   Use destructured objects as function params?
